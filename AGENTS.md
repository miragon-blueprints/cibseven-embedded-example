# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents (and humans) working in this repo. This is the real file; `CLAUDE.md` just
imports it (see [ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-agents-md-as-the-single-source.md)).

## Project Overview

A headless **MiraVelo bike-leasing** blueprint: a BPMN process running on an embedded CIB seven
engine, behind an enforced hexagonal architecture. There is **no frontend** — the service is driven
over REST, and the CIB seven webapps (Cockpit / Tasklist) handle any human-in-the-loop steps.

- **Backend** — Spring Boot 4, hexagonal, CIB seven 2.2 embedded engine (JavaDelegates invoked by
  expression, **not** Zeebe workers). Package root `io.miragon.blueprint`.
<!-- variant:blueprint -->
- **Two equivalent variants on `main`** — `kotlin-gradle/` (Kotlin, **the recommended stack**) and
  `java-maven/` (Java 21, for teams bound to it and for trainings). They share the models in `shared/`
  and must stay functionally identical: **make every change in behaviour in both variants in the same
  PR.** Changes that only concern one language's idioms stay on that side. See
  [ADR-0013](docs/adr/0013-two-stack-variants-side-by-side-on-main.md). The OpenAPI contract below is
  drift-gated against **both** variants.
  Stack-specific content in shared files (docs, Dependabot, Conductor settings) is wrapped in
  `variant:<name>` markers so `scripts/create-starter.sh` can strip it — see
  [docs/starter.md](docs/starter.md).
<!-- /variant:blueprint -->

- **The contract** is `openapi/openapi.json`: springdoc generates it from the controllers, it is
  **committed and drift-gated** in CI. It is the published contract for any
  REST consumer — a backend REST change that isn't re-exported fails the drift gate. See
  [ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-openapi-as-the-checked-in-contract.md).

```

## Development Setup

Two commands to a running service — Postgres, then the backend + engine on :8080:

```bash
docker compose -f stack/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

<!-- variant:kotlin-gradle -->
```bash
cd kotlin-gradle && ./gradlew :service:app:bootRun
```
<!-- /variant:kotlin-gradle -->
<!-- variant:java-maven -->
```bash
cd java-maven && ./mvnw -DskipTests install && ./mvnw -pl service/app spring-boot:run
```
<!-- /variant:java-maven -->

### Ports (one source of truth — keep README, this file and `.conductor/settings.toml` in sync)

| What | Port |
|---|---|
| Postgres | 5432 |
| Backend (REST + `/engine-rest`) | 8080 |
| CIB seven Cockpit / Tasklist / webapps | 8080/camunda (admin/admin) |
| OpenAPI spec · Swagger UI | 8080/v3/api-docs · 8080/swagger-ui.html |
| Actuator (health/liveness/readiness · prometheus) | 8080/actuator |

Under Conductor the ports are fixed and the workspace runs `nonconcurrent`
(see [ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-fixed-ports-for-v1-portless-as-the-upgrade.md)).

## Build Commands

<!-- variant:kotlin-gradle -->
| Area (run in `kotlin-gradle/`) | Command |
|---|---|
| Backend (arch + unit + process + model validation + spec export) | `./gradlew build` |
| Mutation testing (gate 80) | `./gradlew :service:app:pitest` |
| Regenerate the typed BPMN process API (after editing a `.bpmn`) | `./gradlew generateBpmnModels` |
| Regenerate the OpenAPI contract | `./gradlew :service:app:test --tests "io.miragon.blueprint.openapi.OpenApiSpecExportTest"` |
| Backend OCI image (`miravelo/cibseven-embedded-example`) | `./gradlew :service:app:bootBuildImage` |
<!-- /variant:kotlin-gradle -->

<!-- variant:java-maven -->
| Area (run in `java-maven/`) | Command |
|---|---|
| Backend (arch + unit + process + model validation + spec export) | `./mvnw verify` |
| Mutation testing (gate 80) | `./mvnw -pl service/app -am test-compile org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage` |
| Regenerate the typed BPMN process API (after editing a `.bpmn`) | `./mvnw -pl service/app generate-sources` |
| Regenerate the OpenAPI contract | `./mvnw -pl service/app -am test -Dtest=OpenApiSpecExportTest -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false` |
| Backend OCI image (`miravelo/cibseven-embedded-example`) | `./mvnw -pl service/app -am -DskipTests spring-boot:build-image` |
<!-- /variant:java-maven -->

| Area (repo root) | Command |
|---|---|
| Verify the OpenAPI contract after regenerating it | `git diff --exit-code openapi/openapi.json` |
| API scenarios (running stack) | `cd bruno && npx --yes @usebruno/cli@4.0.0 run . --env local -r` |
| BPMN lint | `npm run lint:bpmn` |

The OCI image decision is [ADR-0011](docs/adr/0011-build-and-deployment-approach.md); the how-to is
CONTRIBUTING "Run it in containers".

## Architecture — the rules are machine-enforced

The backend's hexagonal rules live in `service/common-architecture-tests` (ArchUnit, plus a
source-level tool for the rules bytecode cannot express) and **fail the build** (see [ADR-0007](docs/adr/0007-two-architecture-test-tools-archunit-and-konsist.md)).
Read `HexagonalArchitectureTest.kt` and `NamingConventionArchitectureTest.kt` before writing code. The
hard rules:

- **One inbound port per controller.** `onlyFulfilOneUseCase` counts constructor params in
  `application.port.inbound` and fails at >1. An inbox listing + a completion are two controllers.
- **No new top-level `config` package.** The containment rule ignores only *direct* members of the
  root package, so `io.miragon.blueprint.config` would fail. Cross-cutting `@Configuration` (CORS,
  OpenAPI, error handling) goes in `adapter.inbound.rest` — the `Configuration` suffix is whitelisted
  there.
- **`adapter/process` is generated.** Never hand-edit `*ProcessApi` or the shared
  `ServiceTasks`/`Messages`/`ProcessVariables`/`Errors`/`Escalations` files; edit the `.bpmn` in
  `shared/bpmn` and regenerate.
- **Suffixes:** inbound port `UseCase|Query`; outbound `Port|Repository|Process`; service
  `Service|Configuration`; `adapter.inbound.rest` `Controller|Dto|Input|Mapper|Configuration`;
  `adapter.inbound.cibseven` `Delegate|Worker|Listener`; `adapter.outbound`
  `PersistenceAdapter|Adapter|Mapper|Entity|Repository`.
- **Spring Data types stop at the adapter.** Ports own their own `Filter`/`Page`/`Criteria` types.

## BPMN Quality Gates

- `bpmn-to-code` generates typed process constants from the models at build time; a custom model
  test requires every service task to use a delegate expression (`#{beanName}`).
- Since bpmn-to-code 6 the API is node-centric: `<Process>ProcessApi.FlowNodes.<Node>` carries the
  element (`.id`, `ELEMENT_ID`), its `Variables` and its successors (`Next`). Process tests assert
  the walked path as a compile-checked `ProcessPath` (`process/util/ProcessPathAssertions.kt`)
  instead of hand-maintained element-id lists.
- `bpmnlint` runs on staged `.bpmn` via `.githooks/pre-commit` (install: `npm run hooks:install`).

## Testing

TDD. Match the test style to the layer:

| Layer | Test style |
|---|---|
| domain | plain unit tests |
| application service | unit tests with mocked ports |
| `adapter.inbound.rest` | `@WebMvcTest` with the use case mocked |
| `adapter.outbound.db` | `@DataJpaTest` |
| process end-to-end | CIB seven process tests, paths asserted via `ProcessPath` |

**Mutation testing gates PRs at 80**: a test that executes without asserting
will fail CI. Coverage says a line ran; mutation says a test would have noticed. The PR gate runs
**diff-scoped** (only the classes the PR changed, still blocking); the **full-module** gate-80 sweep
runs nightly. See [ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-mutation-testing-as-a-blocking-pr-gate.md).

## Verify After Each Task (targeted, not a full build)

<!-- variant:blueprint -->
Verify the variant you touched — which, for a change in behaviour, is both.
<!-- /variant:blueprint -->

<!-- variant:kotlin-gradle -->
In `kotlin-gradle/`:

- Backend service/controller: `./gradlew :service:app:test --tests "*<Name>Test"`
- Architecture only: `./gradlew :service:app:test --tests "io.miragon.blueprint.architecture.*"`
<!-- /variant:kotlin-gradle -->

<!-- variant:java-maven -->
In `java-maven/`:

- Backend service/controller: `./mvnw -pl service/app -am test -Dtest="<Name>Test" -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false`
- Architecture only: `./mvnw -pl service/app -am test -Dtest="ArchitectureTest" -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false`
<!-- /variant:java-maven -->

From the repo root:

- Contract changed: regenerate the spec, then `git diff --exit-code openapi/openapi.json`
- Process changed: regenerate the process API, then the `process.*` tests

## Working with GitHub

Use the `gh` CLI. Write everything (issues, PRs, commit messages) in **English**. Use
**Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `ci:`, `build:`).

## ADRs

Architecture decisions are recorded in `docs/adr/`. Read them to understand *why* the repo is shaped
this way before proposing structural changes.

## Personality

You are a knowledgeable colleague, not someone who passively takes orders. If something proposed
doesn't look right, suggest corrections, ask critical questions, and push back where needed.
Challenge ideas that could benefit from further improvement or iterative refinement rather than just
accepting them at face value.
