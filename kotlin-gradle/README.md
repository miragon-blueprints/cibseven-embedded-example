# Kotlin + Gradle variant

The bike-leasing service in **Kotlin 2.4**, built with **Gradle** and a `libs.versions.toml` version
catalog, on Spring Boot 4 and an embedded CIB seven 2.2 engine.

<!-- variant:blueprint -->
> [!TIP]
> **This is the stack we recommend** when you are free to choose. Null-safety keeps the domain model and
> the OpenAPI contract precise without annotations, `data` and `value` classes keep the domain compact,
> and Konsist adds source-level architecture rules that bytecode analysis cannot express. The
> [Java + Maven variant](../java-maven/README.md) is functionally identical for teams bound to that stack.

## Commands

Run them from this directory. Postgres comes from `docker compose -f ../stack/docker-compose.yml up -d`.

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Run the service on :8080 | `./gradlew :service:app:bootRun` |
| Full build (arch + unit + process + model validation + spec export) | `./gradlew build` |
| Mutation testing (gate 80) | `./gradlew :service:app:pitest` |
| Regenerate the typed process API after editing a `.bpmn` | `./gradlew generateBpmnModels` |
| Build the OCI image | `./gradlew :service:app:bootBuildImage` |

## How it is built

- **Hexagonal architecture.** Domain and use cases never depend on CIB seven, so the business logic is
  testable and the engine replaceable. `common-architecture-tests` enforces it with **ArchUnit**
  (bytecode: layering, dependency direction, naming) and **Konsist** (source: one declaration per file,
  no wildcard imports); a service opts in with `class ArchitectureTest : ServiceArchitectureTest(...)`.
- **Generated process API.** The `bpmn-to-code` Gradle plugin turns each `.bpmn` into a typed,
  node-centric `*ProcessApi` object, so element ids, messages, timers, variables and the paths the
  process tests walk are compile-checked. Never hand-edit `adapter/process`.
- **Unit tests** (JUnit 5 + MockK) cover every domain type, service and adapter — controllers via
  `@WebMvcTest`, persistence via `@DataJpaTest`.
- **Process tests** (`cibseven-bpm-assert`) drive the deployed model deterministically: timers and async
  continuations are fired and messages correlated by hand, and the walked path is asserted as a
  compile-checked `ProcessPath`.
- **Model validation** (`bpmn-to-code-testing`) checks the models at build time, including a custom rule
  that every service task uses a delegate expression.
- **Mutation testing** (PIT, gate 80) grades assertion strength — diff-scoped on pull requests, full
  sweep nightly.
- **OpenAPI contract.** A test exports the springdoc spec to [`../openapi/openapi.json`](../openapi/openapi.json);
  CI fails on drift.
